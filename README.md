# Diffusion1D
Simple 1D diffusion code solving it numerically using finite differences approach

Solving for 1D diffusion equation 

$$\frac{\partial{C}}{\partial{t}} = D\frac{\partial^2{C}}{\partial{x^2}} $$

This is applicable to all diffusion like problems like heat diffusion where we would have Temperature instead of C.

$$\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}} = D\frac{\partial^2{T}}{\partial{x^2}} $$

This MATLAB code produces a simulation of consecutive timestep evaluations of concentration from initial conditions.
